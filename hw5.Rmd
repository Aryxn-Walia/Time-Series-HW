### 1. Explaining the Output

The model selected by `auto.arima()` is **ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,0)[12]**, which means:

- **p = 2**: Two autoregressive terms (AR).
- **d = 1**: First-order differencing to remove trend.
- **q = 1**: One moving average term (MA).
- **Seasonal (0,1,0)[12]**: One seasonal differencing applied, no seasonal AR/MA terms.

The coefficients section shows the estimated values for ar1, ar2, and ma1, with standard errors.  
The model fit is measured by:

- **AIC = 1017.85**, **BIC = 1029.35**: Lower values indicate a better model.
- **sigmaÂ² = 132.3**: The variance of the residuals; lower means better fit.

These values suggest the model fits the data well and captures both trend and seasonality.
