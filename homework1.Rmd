#The age distribution shows that most employees are between 35 and 45 years old, with an average age of just under 40. This means that the employees at this company are mostly middle-aged. There are some unusual cases, like employees who are over 60 and those who are around 21 years old.
boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Age, main="Age Distribution", col="lightblue")
#Employees generally receive lower weekly salaries, according to the salary distribution (we'll take this as weekly pay multiplied by 100). Although there are notable outliers, which may be the result of higher positions paying more, the distribution indicates that employees normally make between $200 and $1000 per week.
boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Salary, main="Salary Distribution", col="lightgreen")
#Overall, it appears that the employees are satisfied (5 being very satisfied, 1 being very unsatisfied). The fact that so few employees appear to have given this company a score of 1 suggests that working there is more desirable than not.
boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Satisfaction, main="Satisfaction Distribution", col="lightcoral")
#The majority of the staff members have been with the company for four or more years, according to their years of experience.   
boxplot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$YearsExperience, main="Years of Experience Distribution", col="lightgray")

# Histograms
#A much more straightforward visual depiction of the distribution is provided by the age histogram. It is evident that the majority of the employees are middle-aged, with most of them being between the ages of 30 and 40.
hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Age, main="Age Distribution", col="lightblue", xlab="Age", breaks=10)
#The age histogram offers a far simpler visual representation of the distribution. It is clear that most of the staff members are middle-aged, with the majority falling between the ages of thirty and forty.
hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Salary, main="Salary Distribution", col="lightgreen", xlab="Salary", breaks=10)
#The majority of employees have assigned a score of 5 (Very satisfied), according to the Satisfaction Score histogram. Although the reason given by an employee is not stated, this indicates that the company is one that is appealing and fun to work for.
hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Satisfaction, main="Satisfaction Score Distribution", col="lightcoral", xlab="Satisfaction", breaks=10)
#TThe Years of Experience Histogram reveals that while the majority of employees have five years of experience, nearly as many have only one or two years. This suggests that this organization frequently brings on new hires, albeit in smaller numbers than more seasoned staff members.

hist(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$YearsExperience, main="Years of Experience Distribution", col="lightgray", xlab="Years of Experience", breaks=10)
#This barplot shows that most employees at this company work at Department 1.
barplot(table(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Department), main="Employee Count by Department", col="lightblue", ylab="Count", xlab="Department")

# Relationship between Salary and Years of Experience
# The plot demonstrates that years of experience and salary do not significantly correlate, suggesting that the company may value employees' salaries based on other factors rather than years of experience.
plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$YearsExperience, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data_copy$Salary, main="Salary vs Years of Experience", xlab="Years of Experience", ylab="Salary", col="blue", pch=19)

# Relationship between Salary and Satisfaction
#Even though the plot indicates that people with low salaries tended to rate their level of satisfaction at 1, those who gave themselves a five-star rating did so despite receiving nearly the same salary. This may suggest that there are more benefits to working for this company than just the pay. (For instance, benefits, company culture, etc.).
